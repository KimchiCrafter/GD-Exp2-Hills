This is a simple game design experiment I created.

To use it, follow those steps:
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract all the files from the zip file anywhere convenient
3. Double-click on the .exe file you just extracted
4. Interact with the experiment for at least 1 minute
5. What did you feel during this interaction?
